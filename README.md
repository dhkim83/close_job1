The app uses data from the Indeed Jobsearch API and the Walkscore TravelTime API to provide a new way to look for jobs.  Commute time isnâ€™t the only important factor in deciding on a job, but it can influence the quality of life for people in major metropolitan areas. 
 
On my list of potential features to add are:
Ability to turn congestion on and off.
Conversion of seconds into minutes.
Ability to sort results by commute time.
Ability to find travel times for walking and/or public transit.
Ability to show a map of areas that can be reached by a travel time entered by the user.

Special thanks to Adam Schuld.
